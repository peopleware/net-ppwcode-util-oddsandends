# PPWCode.Util.OddsAndEnds

This library is part of the PPWCode project and is a collection of several
small helpers and utility code.


## Getting started

### PPWCode.Util.OddsAndEnds II

This is version II of the library, which is designed to work with Microsoft .NET 4.5.

The library is available as the [NuGet] package `PPWCode.Util.OddsAndEnds.II`
in the [NuGet Gallery].  It can be installed using the Nuget package manager from 
inside Visual Studio.


### PPWCode.Util.OddsAndEnds I

Version I of the library is still available in maintenance mode, and is 
compatible with Microsoft .NET 3.5.

This version is available on the git branch `stable/I`. It is currently not available
in the [NuGet Gallery].  One can however build the package oneself and publish it
on a local repository.

We intend to make it available at some point in the future as the [NuGet] 
package `PPWCode.Util.OddsAndEnds.I`.  From then on, one will be able to install
it using the Nuget package manager from inside Visual Studio.

* [PPWCode project website]
* [PPWCode Google Code website]

Please note that not all information on those sites is up-to-date. We are
currently in the process of moving the code away from the Google code
subversion repositories to git repositories on [GitHub].


### PPWCode .NET

Specifically for the .NET libraries: new development will be done on the
[PeopleWare GitHub repositories], and all new stable releases will also
be published as packages on the [NuGet Gallery].

We believe in Design By Contract and have good experience with
[Microsoft Code Contracts] and the related tooling.  As such, our packages
always include Contract Reference assemblies.  This allows you to also
benefit as a user from the contracts that are already included in the
library code.

The packages also include both the pdb and xml files, for debugging symbols
and documentation respectively.  In the future we might look into using
symbol servers.
